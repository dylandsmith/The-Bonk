        <p>The road to hell is paved with good intentions. While film makers strive to create masterpieces, 
        often the film's gross profits fall well below what it took took make and advertise the film. That doesn't mean that the film is bad.</p>
        <p>Many cult classics were box office flops. Some films went on to make more money in video/streaming services. 
        Word of mouth can give a film new legs and sometimes it just takes a while for a film to build an audience.</p>
